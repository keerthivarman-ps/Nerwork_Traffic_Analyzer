Network Traffic Analysis

🛰️ Network Traffic Analysis is a Python-based project that captures, monitors, and analyzes network traffic to identify patterns, detect anomalies, and gain insights into network behavior. This tool is designed for network administrators, security researchers, and anyone interested in understanding network activity at a deeper level.

📌 Features

- Capture live network packets
- Analyze and filter traffic by protocol (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.)
- Extract and summarize packet metadata (source IP, destination IP, ports, etc.)
- Basic intrusion detection indicators (e.g., suspicious traffic patterns)
- Save captured data for offline analysis
- Generate visual reports and statistics

🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python — Core programming language
- Scapy — Packet capture and manipulation
- PyShark — Python wrapper for TShark (optional for advanced packet parsing)
- Wireshark / TShark — For deeper packet dissection (optional)
- Pandas — Data analysis and handling
- Matplotlib / Seaborn — Data visualization and traffic plotting
- SQLite / CSV — Storing captured packet information
- Socket — For low-level network operations

📈 How It Works

1. Capture: Use raw sockets or Scapy to sniff live network traffic.
2. Analyze: Parse packets to extract useful fields like IP addresses, ports, and protocols.
3. Store: Optionally save captured data to CSV or a local database.
4. Visualize: Plot traffic volume over time, protocol distributions, and highlight anomalies.

🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/network-traffic-analysis.git
   cd network-traffic-analysis
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the traffic analyzer:
   ```bash
   sudo python traffic_analyzer.py
   ```

> ⚠️ Note: Some features (like packet sniffing) may require administrative/root privileges.

🧠 Future Improvements

- Advanced anomaly detection using Machine Learning
- Web dashboard for live traffic monitoring
- Alert system for suspicious activities
- Support for encrypted traffic analysis (basic level)
- Integration with ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
